    <h1> Hey Everyone!</h1>
    <p> My name is Brittany Fisher and I'm 29 years old. I am orignally from Washington DC but for the past few years, Georgia has been home. 
        I love all things tactical and enjoy hiking in my spare time. I have an obsession with 5.11 tactical and I'm super excited to take my jeep 
        up to the mountains in a few weeks. I have way too much survival gear in my amazon cart and own way too many tactical bags.</p[>
        
        <p>My beautiful fiance's name is Michaele. She's amazing because even though she teases me about always being prepared for the worst, she knows that it brings me peace
            to sit on the side of a mountain away from the world and live simply. 
            Here is a list of other things I enjoy.</p>
